# SolsticeNgAssessment

## Problem Statement

Solstice has an opportunity to win an engagement deal with the NFL. To land the deal, solstice needs to present a working POC to the client. You have been tasked with creating a SPA(single page application) that supports commonly used mobile devices. The app will display NFL teams in order of teams with a player who has the highest passing yards to the lowest passing yards(descending order). In case there is a tie, team with a higher average passing yards will be ranked above the team with the lower passing yards. 

## Notes

Basic architecture of the app is setup for you. Write a test before writing any production code; following the Red, Green, Refactor strategy. 

Use the NflDataService to populate the NflDataComponent. Do not modify the service and/or the nflData.json.
